												<p><b>HOME LOAN</b>
														You must be at least 21 years of age for the loan to be sanctioned. The loan must terminate before or when you turn 65 years of age. You must be employed or self-employed with a regular source of income.</p>
														<p><b>Office premise loan</b>
<br>
																You must be at least 21 years of age for the loan to be sanctioned. The loan must terminate before or when you turn 65 years of age. You must be self-employed with a regular source of income. The loan can be for the purchase / construction / extension of a non-residential or commercial property. A loan for renovation or improvement will be given only at the time of acquisition of property. Professionally qualified and self-employed individuals can apply. A minimum of 3 year’s work experience is a must.
																<br>
																<b>Loan Amount</b><br>
																A number of factors such as your income, age, number of dependants, qualifications, assets and liabilities, income stability/ continuity of your employment / business etc. are taken into account when assessing your repayment capacity.
																<br>
																However, there are ways by which you can enhance your eligibility: If your spouse is earning, add him/her as a co-applicant. The additional income shall be included to enhance your loan amount. Incidentally, if there are any co-owners they must necessarily be co-applicants. Did you know that your fiancée’s income could also be considered for sanctioning the loan on your combined income? The disbursement of the loan, however, is done only after you submit proof of your marriage. Providing additional security like bonds, fixed deposits and LIC policies may also help to enhance eligibility. While there is no need for a guarantor, having one might enhance your credibility with us. If so, our loan officer would provide you with the necessary details. However, the final amount to be sanctioned will depend on your repayment capacity. In the total cost, registration charges, transfer charges and stamp duty costs are included.
																<br>
																<b>Sanctioning</b><br>
																Documents required for applying for a home loan (for self-employed professionals and businessmen)</p>
																<p><b>Disbursement</b><br>
																		Your loan will be disbursed after you identify and select the property that you are purchasing and submit the requisite legal documents. Each and every single document asked for will be verified and checked for your safety. This may take some time but we want to ensure a clear title by completing all the legal and technical verifications so that you have full rights to your home. The 230 A Clearance of the seller and / or 37I clearance from the appropriate income tax authorities (if applicable) is also needed. On satisfactory completion of the above, registration of the conveyance deed and investment of your own contribution, the loan amount (as warranted by the stage of construction) will be disbursed by Bank. The disbursement will be in favour of the builder/seller.</p>

													<p>RERA  Guidelines</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-md-12">
														
																<p>In order to escalate the responsibility and accountability towards consumers the RERA has mandated real estate developers (also known as real estate promoters) to register the project (measuring more than 500 square meters or more than eight apartments) and obtain a valid registration number before proceeding. He/she is not permitted to market, advertise or sell the units before the registration of the project. If the project is to be developed in phases then the developer have to obtain registration for each phase separately.<br><br>

																		The developer is required to submit all the necessary documents related to the project as prescribed by RERA. It is mandatory for a real estate developer to open an escrow account in a bank recognized by the government and must deposit 70% of the total payment received from the consumer. He/she can withdraw the money and should solely use it for the development of the said project after getting it approved from an engineer, architect or chartered accountant.<br><br>
																		
																		If the developer fails to comply with the directions or violates the rules prescribed by RERA or the Appellate Tribunal then, he/she may face imprisonment up to three years with a fine of up to 10% of the total estimated cost of the project in question.</p>
